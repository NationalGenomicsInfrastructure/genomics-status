<br>
<p>In various stages of data production in the genomics platform metadata about this data
is created, and stored in a database (known as StatusDB). This service provides an
interface to commonly accessed data, and functionality to generate plots regarding
the statistics of this data.</p>

<p>Data is put in the database from various sources. Time series statistics about
systems are mostly gathered by cron jobs on the systems in question.</p>

<p>Data about projects and samples are currently converted from the spreadsheets used
to keep track of these. For questions regarding this, contact Maya Brandi.</p>

<p>In particular, the number of samples in a project, as well as the minimum
number of reads per sample is eneterd manually by Mattias Ormestad</p>

<p>Data about runs of samples and flowcells are collected while generating
statistics in the end of the data processing pipeline, then uploaded to the
database. Most of the scripts which generate these statistics and put them in
the database have been created by Per Unneberg (as part of the <a href="https://github.com/SciLifeLab/scilifelab/tree/master/scilifelab/pm">pm
tools</a>).</p>

<p>Most data have been reliably collected since January 1st 2012, in some instances there
are earlier data.</p>

<p>For general information about Status, or feature requests, contact Johannes Alneberg.</p>

<p>Code for Status can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/scilifelab/status">Github</a>.</p>
