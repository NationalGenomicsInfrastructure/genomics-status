Managing Users
==============
Genomic Status reads stored users from the "gs_users" database on the couch_server. 
To add a new user, a document with a user with keys "email" and "password_hash" needs to be defined.

Generating Password Hashes
--------------------------
The following code can be used to generate the password hash:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    password = "secret_1"
    seed = "Rey1zu^r0vv^(Qf" # Random string, can be generated by os.urandom(15)
    import hashlib
    password_hash = hashlib.sha256(seed + password).hexdigest()
    print password_hash

To add a new user to the system, currently, the same seed has to be used as for the previous users. 
This seed is stored in the "settings.yaml" file. The motivation to have both a hashed password and a seed
is that even if the hashed password is compromised, the original passphrase is still very hard to reconstruct.
